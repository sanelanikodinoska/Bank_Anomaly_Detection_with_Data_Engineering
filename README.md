# Bank-Clients-Anomaly-Prediction-Model-with-Data-Engineering

The aim of this project was to:
- ingest raw, real-world data from several tables stored in Google Cloud
   - in notebooks and scripts:
- preprocess, transform data and load it to Google Cloud
- build unsupervised anomaly detection model
- deploy it on Streamlit app to get predictions

### Data ingestion from Google Cloud Bucket:
- one excel file "Banking Clients' with three data sheets: 'Clients - Banking', 'Nationality', 'Clients';
- two .txt files: 'Banking Contact', 'Investment Advisor'

### Merging tables:
data modeling

### Uploading clean data to Cloud
flatten data for ML and BI usage

### ANOMALY DETECTION MODEL CREATION 
- Unsupervised Isololation Forest model 

### Get predictions
- both on notebook and on Streamlit app
